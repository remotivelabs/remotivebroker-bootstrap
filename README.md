# RemotiveBroker bootstrapped

## Run it yourself

Remotive Labs provides integrations to various platforms ([read more](https://remotivelabs.github.io/)), however in many cases 
you might prefer to host the software in a machine of your choice. If so; you are in the correct location, 
keep reading.

prerequisites:
- `docker` 
- `docker-compose`
- `git` 
- `inotify-tools` (optional)

### Step 1/3 start using docker 

Clone this repository and make sure you have `docker` and `docker-compose`
installed, then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command only needs to be run once. It is persistent over system reboot --
the containers will be restarted after a reboot, over and over again.

Point your web browser at the machine running RemotiveBroker, an address like
`http://192.0.2.42:8080/`. 


**Please note**, *the following license applies to the usage of Remotive Labs products, which is also shown when you run `docker-compose up` in attached mode.*
```

**DONE**! Now improve your experience by applying next step. 


### Step 2/3 (optional, quality of life improvement) Upgrade through the web interface

In order to allow upgrades triggered by the user interface you need to install a 
custom service. To install and start this service (only needed once):

```bash
sudo scripts/install-service.sh
```

> This script assumes that you are running on a host where `systemd` is present 

### Step 3/3 Get evaluation license

Navigate to you local broker [here](http://127.0.0.1:8080) and select the `License` tab and follow the instructions to aquire your license. 

## Custom can interfaces

RemotiveBroker support all can interfaces which supports `socket-can`. Many USB 
can connectors are supported by default by the linux kernel. Typically, it will appear
when you do `ip a` then you simply need to do:
```bash
#can/canfd
ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000 dbitrate 2000000 restart-ms 1000 berr-reporting on fd on
## less capable device 
#can
ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000 dbitrate 2000000 restart-ms 1000 berr-reporting on

## if above doesn't work try
ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 500000 restart-ms 1000
```
> Remember to run as sudo if you run from shell


Setting up these interfaces on boot on Raspbian would look as follows
```bash
cat /etc/network/interfaces.d/can
```

```bash
auto can0
iface can0 inet manual
  pre-up /sbin/ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000 dbitrate 8000000 restart-ms 1000 berr-reporting on fd on
  up     /sbin/ip link set can0 txqueuelen 65536 up
  down   /sbin/ip link set can0 down
auto can1
iface can1 inet manual
  pre-up /sbin/ip link set can1 type can bitrate 500000 dbitrate 8000000 restart-ms 1000 berr-reporting on fd on
  up     /sbin/ip link set can1 txqueuelen 65536 up
  down   /sbin/ip link set can1 down

## some devices do not support berr-reporting on
## if above doesn't work try
iface can2 inet manual
  pre-up /sbin/ip link set can2 type can bitrate 500000 restart-ms 1000
  up     /sbin/ip link set can2 txqueuelen 65536 up
  down   /sbin/ip link set can2 down
```

## LIN, Flexray and Ethernet

These protocols are carried over ethernet, however dependent on you HW choice let us help. Reach out on [hello@remotivelabs.com](mailto:hello@remotivelabs.com?subject=Help%20with%20setting%20up%20interfaces). 
Some guidance can be located below.

### Technica

It's recommended to install a bridge module on the same host machine. The scrips provided [here](scripts/install-teknika.sh) will install 2 services, allowing two Technica devices (thus enabling 2 flexray interfaces), one on port 51112 and the other on port 51113. 

!> Make sure that your Technica devices is configured to use `PLP` headers and also make sure to note specified `Destination MAC` (available by clicking `SPY`) typically `01:00:5e:00:00:00`. 

Connect your Technica device to the secondary usb ethernet interface `eth1` which is mentioned above. As multicast address provide `Destination MAC`.
```json
{
  "chains": [
      {
         "type": "flexray",
         "device_name": "flexray0",
         "namespace": "MyFlexrayNamespace",
         "config": {
            "target_host": "127.0.0.1",
            "target_port": 51112,
            "hardware": "Technica_CM_CAN_COMBO",
            "target_config": {
               "interface": "eth1",
               "multicast": "01:00:5e:00:00:00"
            }
         },
         "database": "fibex_files/flexray.xml"
      }
   ]
}
```

### Host Mobility MX-4 T30 FR as a flexray forwarding device

The binary located [here](scripts/flexray/flexray2ip.new) need to be installed on the MX-4 T30 FR device. Go [here](scripts/flexray/README.txt) for more information.
```json
{
  "chains": [
      {
         "type": "flexray",
         "device_name": "flexray0",
         "namespace": "MyFlexrayNamespace",
         "config": {
            "target_host": "127.0.0.1",
            "target_port": 51111
         },
         "database": "fibex_files/flexray.xml"
      }
   ]
}
```

## Advanced topics




### Start in distributed mode

This mode enables you to daisy chain machines running RemotiveBroker allowing you to increase number of physical interfaces.
read more [here](configuration_distributed/README.md)

### Time synchronization using PTP

Our prebuild image contains binaries for ptp /home/pi/src/linuxptp typically there is a PTP Grandmaster, to connect go ahead and do:
```bash
sudo ./ptp4l -m -i eth0 -S --step_threshold=1 -f configs/automotive-slave.cfg
```
> Make sure to specify correct interface in the example above `eth0` is used.

### Stop

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Upgrade

When you upgrade; remember to upgrade **THIS** repository as well `git pull`,
as examples are continuously updated and improved. You will also find the
latest pre-generated grpc files in this repository.

```bash
git pull
./upgrade.sh
```

Alternatively, just pull the latest container images manually:

```base
docker-compose pull
```

### Use a specific version

To pull a specific version you can specify custom tag for `REMOTIVEBROKER_TAG` or
`REMOTIVEWEBAPP_TAG`, as in:

```bash
REMOTIVEBROKER_TAG=v1.2.3 docker-compose up -d
```
> If you have done `Step 2/2` above, you can conveniently pick version from the `About` in the user interface.

### Troubleshoot

To start from a clean configuration you could do:
```bash
rm remotivelabs-bootstrap/configuration/boot
```
